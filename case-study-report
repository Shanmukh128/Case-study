First i created a empty repository
In that we created one python file in local repository and push into the remote repository
And i created one new branch modified the file and pushed into new branch and merged both the branchs
-And i collaborated the repository and i clone the repository by using URL.After cloneing i modified
 the date by using the different branch and pushed the changes and raised pull request.Then owner will
 view the pull request and merged the pull request
-Then i made changes in exits file and revert back to old one by using the commit id
-And i created a html page and stored in local repository and pushed into remote repository
-And i created a two tags (v.01,v.02) stored in local repository and pushed into the remote repository by 
 using the push command (git push -u origin <tag name>
-git stash is a like hidden and without giving commiting you have to stash.Then if you want to switch to 
 another branch using stash esaly move to another branch after you have to call the hidden data by using
 git stash pop ot git stash apply calling back to git status. if you want to save the data into thr new
 branch by using the git stash branch <branch name> <stash id> if you delete the stage list using this one
 git stash drop <stash id> it is deleted it you want clear all date in stash list use this one 
 git stash clear all date is cleared in stash list
-git history means it gives all modification and commited history
 by using <git diff> it will gives all the modification we made it will clerly give
 by using <git log> it will gives what and all commited history can be given
-Hooks create a pre-commit hook to navigate to .git/hooks/ and edit pre-commit file and it is used automate tasks
 Add a script (e.g.to check code formatting) and you should give permission to the file by using this command
 Make the hook executable ,chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit and permission and avery is changed
-git rebash <branch name> it is used make commites into future branch it is rebash into the master branch
 git checkout <master> and git rebash <futhur branch>
 And rebase is most poweful command and it cannot using in public repository and rebase is alternative to merge
